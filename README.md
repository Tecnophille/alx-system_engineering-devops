# Variables, if, else and while

Project done during **ALX Software Engineering Programme** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about arithmetic operators, relational operators, boolean operators, comments, declaring variables and loops in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc`
* C files are written according to the BETTY CODING standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |

| `5-print_numbers.c` | Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0` |
| `6-print_numberz.c` | Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, without using `char` variables |
| `7-print_tebahpla.c` | Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse |
| `8-print_base16.c` | Prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase |
| `9-print_comb.c` | Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers |
| `10-print_comb2.c` | Prints the numbers from 00 to 99 |
